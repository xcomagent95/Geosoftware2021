# Server
The Tourguide employs the Express Node.js web application framework. This frameword provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. The application runs on port 3000.
The server provides diffent endpoints called routers for different operations. The routers can be used to add, chnage, delete and retrieve data from the database.

# Routers:

## Search-Router:
The Search-Router can be used to retrieve data from the mongoDB in various formats. These Functions can accessed via "http://localhost:3000/search/".
The following actions are provided:

**getLocations:**
The getLocations function returns the collection containing the locations from the mongoDB as an array. 
It can be called with "http://localhost:3000/search/getLocations".

**getTours:**
The getTours function returns the collection containing the tours from the mongoDB as an array. 
It can be called with "http://localhost:3000/search/getTours".

**getUsedLocations:**
The getUsedLocations function returns the collection containing the locations which are part of a tour from the mongoDB as an array. 
It can be called with "http://localhost:3000/search/getUsedLocations".

**getCollections:**
The getCollections function returns the collections containing the locations and the tours from the mongoDB as an array. 
The locations can accessed with res[0] and the tours can be accessed with res[1]. 
It can be called with "http://localhost:3000/search/getCollections".

**getCombined:**
The getCombined function returns the tours with the complete locations which are part of the tours from the mongoDB as an array. 
It can be called with "http://localhost:3000/search/getCombined".
            
## Add-Router:
The Add-Router can be used to add data from the mongoDB. These Functions can accessed via "http://localhost:3000/add/".
The following actions are provided:

**newLocation:**
The newLocation function adds a new location to the locations collection in the mongoDB. A location needs to have a locationID, an URL and a geometry.
The locationID must be unique. It can be called with "http://localhost:3000/add/newLocation".

**newTour:**
The newTour function adds a new tour to the tours collection in the mongoDB. A tour needs to have a tourID, and a list of locations comprising the tour.
The tourID must be unique. It can be called with "http://localhost:3000/add/newTour".

## Update-Router:

**updateLocation:**
The updateLocation function updates an existing location in the locations collection in the mongoDB. To update an existing location the "old" locationID is needed. The locationID, the URL and the geometry can be redefined. The "new" locationID must be unique. If a loactionID is changed it ist also changed in all tours in which the location is used ("on update cascade"). It can be called with http://localhost:3000/add/updateLocation.

**updateTour:**
The updateTour function updates an existing tour in the tours collection in the mongoDB. To update an existing tour the "old" tourID is needed. The tourID and the loactions comprising the tour can be redefined. The "new" tourID must be unique. It can be called with http://localhost:3000/add/updateTour.

## Delete-Router:

**removeLocation:**
The removeLocation function removes an existing location from the locations collection in the mongoDB. To delete an existing location the locationID is needed. If the location is still part of a tour it can not be removed from the collection ("on delete restrict"). It can be called with http://localhost:3000/add/removeLocation.

**removeTour:**
The removeTour function removes an existing tour from the tours collection in the mongoDB. To delete an existing tour the tourID is needed. 
It can be called with http://localhost:3000/add/removeTour.

# Webpages
## Landingpage

The landding page provides access to the other pages and serves as a sort of hub page.

## Map

The map page provides access the the actual application. Locations and tours can be viewed here. Additionaly nearest busstops from a location and weather information at these busstops can also be requested. It can be accessed via "http://localhost:3000/map".

## Editor

The editor page provides the user with all necessary fucntions to manage the locations and tours. It can be accessed via "http://localhost:3000/editor".

## Impressum

The impressum page contains all legal information regarding the application and links to additional material. It can be accessed via "http://localhost:3000/impressum".

# Database
Data (locations and tours) are stored in a dedicated database. A application employs a MongoDB for this purpose. MongoDB is a document-oriented, noSQL database which can store JSON-like documents. 
## Collections
**locations:**
The locations collection contains the locations.
Each location is comprised of 
- an __id_ which is an object created by mongoDB and acts as an internal primary key
- a _locationID_ which is a user defined string which acts as the identifier for the location in athe application
- a _GeoJson_ which contains the geometry (point or polygon) and the URL and description properties

The point locations are formatted like:

    {
     "type": "FeatureCollection",
      "features": [{
       "type": "Feature",
        "properties": {
         "Name": "name of the location (indentical to nameID)",
         "URL": "some URL",
         "Description": "some description (filled automatically)"
         },
        "geometry": {
         "type": "Point",
         "coordinates": [some longitude, some latitude]
        }
      }]
     }
     
The polygon locations are formatted like: 

    {
     "type": "FeatureCollection",
      "features": [{
       "type": "Feature",
        "properties": {
         "Name": "name of the location (indentical to nameID)",
         "URL": "some URL",
         "Description": "some description (filled automatically)"
         },
        "geometry": {
         "type": "Polygon",
         "coordinates": 
         [
          [
           [some longitude, some latitude],
           [some longitude, some latitude],
           [some longitude, some latitude],
           [some longitude, some latitude],
           [some longitude, some latitude]
          ]
         ]
        }
      }]
     }

**tours:**
The tours collection contains the tours.
Each tour is comprised of 
- an __id_ which is an object created by mongoDB and acts as an internal primary key
- a _tourID_ which is a user defined string which acts as the identifier for the tour in athe application
- _locations_ which contain the _locationID_ of the locations which are part of the tour
